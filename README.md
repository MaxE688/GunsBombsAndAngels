When you click start you will be prompted to setup the game. Decide on the number of teams, assign team names, choose the number of
lives each team has, and a few other options as well. To continue to the game board, click start agian. 

Once the game is ready, you will ask a question to your students. Click the select button corrisponding with the team who correctly 
answered the question, and prompt the team to choose a square on the board.

Each square has 1 of 4 symbols: small gun, big gun, bomb, and angel. The small gun, and big gun will take points away from another team.
The small gun takes 1 life, and the big gun takes 2 lives. The bomb will take 1 life away from the team that chose it, and the angel will
give 1 life to the team that chose it.

Continue asking questions until there is only one team remaining. This team is the winner.
